    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Prego no Pão is a simple and delicious Portuguese steak sandwich, available in almost every snack-bar across the country. Like, every Portuguese recipe we have shared so far, they are also associated with a specific town, in this case, Sintra!  </p>
    <p>The prego, like a bifana is a simple sandwich, consisting of a soft white roll filled with fried meat. In this case it’s a thin slice of beefsteak with lots of fried garlic.  It’s not heavily marinated, or particularly saucey, and is usually served with a yellow mustard. Quite popular is to have it com ovo, that’s served topped with a fried egg.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 white bread rolls</li>
        <li>2 beef steaks</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>1 tsp olive oil</li>
        <li>Yellow mustard</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gently pound the steak to tenderize it (if you don’t have a tenderizer, a rolling pin works well).</li>
        <li>Roughly chop the garlic, then place it on top of the meat. Gently pound it again, crushing the garlic into the meat. Season it with salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Place a medium frying pan over high heat. Once hot, add the butter, olive oil and a bay leaf.</li>
        <li>Fry the meat. If using a thin steak, you should need less than 2 minutes on each side.</li>
        <li>Remove the steak from the frying pan, reduce the heat to medium.</li>
        <li>Cut the bread in half and quickly toast it on the same frying pan you used for the steak.</li>
        <li>Spread a good amount of mustard over the bread, place your steak on top. Savour it with your favourite beer!</li>
    </ol>
